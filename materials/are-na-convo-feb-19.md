Take a moment to review the proposed features you've put 
together and consider the readings of this semester so far. 

For those of you who have used are.na take a moment to reflect
 on the site, its interface, community, and content.

Put together a question or two (or three) that you might 
have in preparation for today's conversation.

- delicious bookmarking (first site to make/use/coin "tags")
- https://pinboard.in/recent
- basecamp
- github

anti-algorithm (catered browsing, decreasing friction)
	usefulness vs frictionless
	to make easier vs to allow you to do something you couldn't do before

what is are.na made of?
- block (content), connection (*), channel (a metaphorical folder, a tag with permissions)
	- * position, connectable id, connectable type, channel id
- core rule: content can exist in a variety of contexts

- interface as a wrapper of a datastructure (are.na: graph database)

- can you use are.na incorrectly? (what lends itself to some people using it and others not)
- usage vs experience (get your friends to use it (actually))

"emergent behaviour" from some sort of baseline structure
	- does the database format lend itself to emergence? 
	- does the nomenclature (channel, block, connection) lend itself to a particular use? :naming has a lot of power to produce abstractions, interpretations, etc
	- are.na: clumsiness as novice or part of the design? 

taxonomy: folksonomy: if everyone shares a tag, its meaning gets over-interpreted? 

- viewing access vs user
	- even the act of making those accessible suddenly opens channels up to much wider behaviours and networks (search engines, levels of public-ness) 

- "neutral": making things look the same
	- how can we make the content overpower the branding
	- moderation and the balance between receding and regulation
		- "community garden": one step ahead of any bad actor
		- its a little bit hard to use, so maybe a little bit more difficult to spam
		- a reflection of the team working on it (intro vs extrovert)	

- day-to-day:
	- funding strategy
	- launching of groups
		- what are the advantages of creating and using are.na groups (or even initially using single-player mode)
	- are.na brain, what does a class' brain look like? 

- clunky vs seamless
