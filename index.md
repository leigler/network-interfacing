## March 5
### In-class:
- Class discussion in response to James Bridle's [Something is wrong with the internet](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2)
- Work session on Feature, individual check-ins

### Assignment
- Continue developing your feature. Take some time this week to prepare a mock-up of documentation/installation instructions. Consider how you will frame this feature to fellow network-users. What benefit does your feature offer? How is it used? How is it installed? Is it customizable (if so, how do you show this?)?

### Prompt
Find a fellow network user's post and create a post in reaction to it.


## February 26
### In-class:
- Class discussion in response to [Turing Complete User](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/) and [Black Gooey Universe](http://unbag.net/issue-2-end/black-gooey-universe/)
- Individual check-ins and work session<br>(Use this in-class setting to pair up and plan out strategies for building your site. Solicit advice regarding how your feature should be customizable (i.e. what variables do you pass into your function)).

### Reading:
- James Bridle's [Something is wrong with the internet](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2)

### Assignment
- Continue clarifying and building out your core feature. Clarify its use-case, what variables user's might be able to manipulate, and how it might influence our network as a whole.

## February 19
### In-class:
- Class discussion on [Silicon Valley’s Sixty-Year Love Affair with the Word “Tool”](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/silicon-valleys-sixty-year-love-affair-with-the-word-tool) text
- Conversation with Cab from are.na ([notes](materials/are-na-convo-feb-19.md))
- Class critique on proposed features

### Reading:
- Olia Lialina&rsquo;s [Turing Complete User](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/)
- American Artist&rsquo;s [Black Gooey Universe](http://unbag.net/issue-2-end/black-gooey-universe/)

### Assignment:
[Enhancement, Week 2](/enhancement#week-2)<br>
Choose a feature and begin developing it. Take note of questions and problems you run into. 

### Prompt: 
Watch a few (at least 3) friends interact with the same interface and document their behaviour. How have they made the interface theirs? What behaviours are consistent? How doe their interaction-flows differ?

### Assignment:

### Prompt: 
Describe a fictional interface you recently came in contact with. What features felt familiar (and how were the signified)? What felt like hyperbole?


## February 5
### In-class:

### Assignment: 
Complete your group&rsquo;s [in-class assignment](/feb-05) for review next class. 

### Prompt:
Which interface influences you the most? Howcome?

## January 29
### In-class:
- Assignment review, questions, and group conversation regarding reading
- In a group of three: let’s re-do the first exercise and post to the network through your interface.
- DatArchive and Sprint 2 introduction

### Reading:
[My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/) by Laurel Schwulst

### Assignment: 
DatArchive API<br>Build / publish a stand-alone dat website. Consider, what would you want to host in a distributed network? What is the format of the medium best suited for? 
	
- If you are comfortable, use the DatArchive API to read and write a JSON file (i.e. your website should read the contents and append it to the DOM. Your site should also offer some sort of interface that can update the file). 
- Goal <br> This sprint should be used to become more comfortable with the concepts of the Dat network and the DatArchive API. Feel free to play around with the API’s different methods.

### Prompt: 

Networks in New York. Document (via writing, photography, sketching) a physical network you encounter. Pay attention to the stops and passages, points of collective and individual behaviours, and how the physical directs the network’s behaviour.




## January 22

### In-class: 

[Dat url spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTTNBRftvCj-_L-M8hwBZuwXps4wBGrrRB6rER0Kqzc/edit?usp=sharing) for in-class exercise.

[Boilerplate](https://github.com/leigler/ni-boilerplate) for Sprint 1.


### Reading:

[Thoughtless Acts](https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/3476765/1b3df7e9a666ff9bd1eb2e24a1adaf2e.pdf?1548259343) by Jane Fulton Suri (here's the [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/callil-capuozzo/thoughtless-acts)) 

watch [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ffpAkviM0) about dat and the beaker browser.

### Assignment:

Please spend some time restyling and digging through the [boilerplate files](https://github.com/leigler/ni-boilerplate). Note what areas you're confused by so we can cover them in class next week. Remember to follow the set up outlined in the readme.md file. Your restyling should focus on: 
	- Your profile display (`loadProfile()`)
  - your post display (`loadPosts()`, `loadPostContent()`),
  - your post submission interface (`isOwner()`, `writePost()`)
  - (don't worry about pulling in other users just yet, we'll go over this in our next class!)
- once you're done, please also add your website's dat url to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTTNBRftvCj-_L-M8hwBZuwXps4wBGrrRB6rER0Kqzc/edit?usp=sharing).
