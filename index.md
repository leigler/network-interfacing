## January 29
### In-class:
- Assignment review, questions, and group conversation regarding reading
- In a group of three: let’s re-do the first exercise and post to the network through your interface.
- DatArchive and Sprint 2 introduction

### Reading:
[My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/) by Laurel Schwulst

### Assignment: 
DatArchive API<br>Build / publish a stand-alone dat website. Consider, what would you want to host in a distributed network? What is the format of the medium best suited for? 
	
- If you are comfortable, use the DatArchive API to read and write a JSON file (i.e. your website should read the contents and append it to the DOM. Your site should also offer some sort of interface that can update the file). 
- Goal <br> This sprint should be used to become more comfortable with the concepts of the Dat network and the DatArchive API. Feel free to play around with the API’s different methods.

### Post Prompt: 

Networks in New York. Document (via writing, photography, sketching) a physical network you encounter. Pay attention to the stops and passages, points of collective and individual behaviours, and how the physical directs the network’s behaviour.




## January 22

### In-class: 

[Dat url spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTTNBRftvCj-_L-M8hwBZuwXps4wBGrrRB6rER0Kqzc/edit?usp=sharing) for in-class exercise.

[Boilerplate](https://github.com/leigler/ni-boilerplate) for Sprint 1.


### Reading:

[Thoughtless Acts](https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/3476765/1b3df7e9a666ff9bd1eb2e24a1adaf2e.pdf?1548259343) by Jane Fulton Suri (here's the [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/callil-capuozzo/thoughtless-acts)) 

watch [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ffpAkviM0) about dat and the beaker browser.

### Assignment:

Please spend some time restyling and digging through the [boilerplate files](https://github.com/leigler/ni-boilerplate). Note what areas you're confused by so we can cover them in class next week. Remember to follow the set up outlined in the readme.md file. Your restyling should focus on: 
	- Your profile display (`loadProfile()`)
  - your post display (`loadPosts()`, `loadPostContent()`),
  - your post submission interface (`isOwner()`, `writePost()`)
  - (don't worry about pulling in other users just yet, we'll go over this in our next class!)
- once you're done, please also add your website's dat url to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTTNBRftvCj-_L-M8hwBZuwXps4wBGrrRB6rER0Kqzc/edit?usp=sharing).
