Group Exercise February 05

<hr>

## Exercise Description
For this exercise, form a group of 2-3. For next class (Feb 12) to design and develop an interface based on the [prompt](#interface-prompt) below.

Your interface should have the ability to<br>1) write and read/display your files, and<br>2) read/display other user&rsquo;s files. Feel free to use the [boilerplate](https://github.com/leigler/ni-boilerplate) or write your own from scratch. 

## Interface Prompt

Consider the reading you did for today ([Laurel's essay on what a website can be](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)). Her essay primarily focuses on a certain kind of website: one in which the author and architect are the same.

We are building (interfaces, websites?) that participate in a network. They are not isolated. Sections of them are public, other sections are private. 

For this interface, respond to how you imagine Laurel&rsquo;s conclusions transfer to a website where you might be (*one of the*) architect(*s*), an author, contributor, *and* an editor, an urban planner, etc..
