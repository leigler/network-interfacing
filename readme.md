# Network Interfacing

Networks and their interfaces dictate how we engage with the world around us. They determine what kind of information we have access to and develop preferences for, how and with whom we communicate, and what we believe. In this course, students will research, design, and develop a peer-to-peer network that allows for an intensive exploration of how interfaces filter our information, guide our social dynamics, and ultimately shape our perceptions and biases.
