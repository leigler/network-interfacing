## Enhancement (functions/features/futures)

### Week 1
For February 20, research and prepare three distinct feature proposals. These should each be formatted in a presentable manner and outline: 
- the suggested feature
- the purpose of the respective feature
- a visual example of implementation (i.e. what do tags look like to add? to use? what can they be used for?)
- considerations regarding implementation (i.e. how might this feature effect the overall network behaviour?)
- considerations regarding development (i.e. will this be implemented into the `profile.json`, the `post-xxx.json`, or somewhere else?) and use of the DatArchive API (what methods do you imagine you might use?)


### Project Brief
Research, design, and develop a new feature for our network that can be implemented by others. Consider what features are part of networks you frequently use. What do they add to your experience? How might our network benefit from them? 

Deliverables: 
- A javascript file containing your featureâ€™s function(s)
- A single-page site introducing and providing documentation on how others might use your function
