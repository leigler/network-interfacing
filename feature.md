## Enhancement (functions/features/futures)

Research, design, and develop a new feature for our network that can be implemented by others. Consider what features are part of networks you frequently use. What do they add to your experience? How might our network benefit from them? 
Deliverables: 
- A javascript file containing your featureâ€™s function(s)
- A single-page site introducing and providing documentation on how others might use your function
