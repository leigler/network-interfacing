# [Home](/)<br>Network Interfacing

[Interfaces](#interface) and [Features](#feature), Conclusion

Both your Interface and your Feature should have their most recent dat url updated on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VTTNBRftvCj-_L-M8hwBZuwXps4wBGrrRB6rER0Kqzc/edit#gid=0).

## Interface
Throughout the semester we've have several moments to iterate interfaces for our network, both in groups and individually. Consider what differentiates interfaces. How does layout influence how an interface's content is weighted? Which features have you installed? How do they shift your post-types and posting habits? Whose posts can you see? In what order?

### Parts
- Your profile information
- Your posts
- Posts from other users in the network
- Your posting interface
- \>1 Feature Installed

## Feature

### Brief and Deliverables
Research, design, and develop a new feature for our network that can be implemented by others. Consider what features are part of networks you frequently use. What do they add to your experience? How might our network benefit from them? 

- A javascript file containing your featureâ€™s function(s) titled: `YOURFUNCTION.js`
- A single-page dat site introducing and providing documentation on how others might install use your function
