# [Home](/)<br>Network Interfacing

Interface Reflection

<hr>

## Part 1
Take the first part of class to reflect on your interface's design and functionality and answer the following questions in a post to the network:
- What is the goal of your interface? What content does it privilege? Does it emphasize your posts, or the network's? How?
- What parts of your design do you find most resolved? What areas feel unresolved?
- Which designed feature did you implement? How does it fit into the overall design of your interface?
- What are the technical constraints of your interface?
- Are there any bugs? Do they impede on the interface's baseline functionality?

## Part 2
Switch interfaces with a classmate and provide a written critique of their interface answering the following (similar) questions:
- What is the goal of their interface? What content does it privilege? 
- What parts of their design do you find most resolved? What areas feel unresolved? 
- Which designed feature did they implement? How does it fit into the overall design of their interface?
- What are the technical constraints of your interface?
- Are there any bugs? Do they impede on the interface's baseline functionality?
